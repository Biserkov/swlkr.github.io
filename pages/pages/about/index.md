Hey, my name is Sean Walker and I like to solve distributed systems problems efficiently and elegantly. I've been writing software for 20 years, 10 of those years I've actually been getting paid to do it! Some of my favorite things are traveling around looking for awesome places to take pictures with my wife, writing code and solving problems quickly with dynamic languages, and eating sushi.
