  <p>Inspired by my introversion, <a href='https://m.signalvnoise.com/theres-such-a-thing-as-too-helpful-91002b411a62'>this post</a> and <a href='http://nomadlist.com/'>nomad list</a> Iâ€™m making <a href='hollabackapp.com'>hollaback</a> a respectful way to show who you are to your website visitors. When I say respect, I mean donâ€™t barge in trying to help them with a chatbox in their face. Thereâ€™s nothing I like less than being sold to on a website. I expect it when Iâ€™m buying a car, but I donâ€™t expect it when visiting your site. They donâ€™t call it <strong>browsing</strong> the web for nothing, let me browse, donâ€™t try to help me. How does hollaback help you as a website owner? Well let me count the ways:</p><h3>Tell your visitors who you are up front, not behind an about link</h3><p>Contrary to popular belief, I like other people even though I tend to be more introverted most of the time, and when I visit a website, it helps me to know thereâ€™s a human or at least a team of people behind it. I usually reach for the about link if Iâ€™m encountering something new and interesting. Itâ€™s always nice to see whoâ€™s behind the site.</p><h3>Simple analytics</h3><p>Iâ€™m currently using google analytics but I donâ€™t really understand it. Iâ€™m sure it works great for pros who know what theyâ€™re doing, but thatâ€™s not me, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing, I just want to see which pages people are visiting and thatâ€™s probably it. All of the info on google analytics is overwhelming. I like the idea of a lot of info, but the way itâ€™s laid out, at least to me, is confusing. So the idea here is to get some basic analytics, where are visitors coming from, what pages did they visit, etc. laid out in an easy way and thatâ€™ll be that.</p><h3>Build your personal brand</h3><p>The most important thing, I think to website ownerâ€™s success, is to build a personal brand. People follow people, not brands (at least I donâ€™t). Products where I know someone whoâ€™s making it typically catch my attention much more than products made by seemingly anonymous people who I donâ€™t really know. So, whatâ€™s better than seeing a face and a name behind a site right there on the site? I think itâ€™ll be better for indie makers and better for visitors to get to know them</p><h3>One up faceless corporations with your face</h3><p>Is your website trying to compete with a large-ish corp? Well, good thing youâ€™re an indie maker and the customers who do appreciate that sort of thing can make their buying decision easier knowing that itâ€™s you and your face behind the product theyâ€™re buying, not just another corp with sales/customer service people who arenâ€™t really into it.</p><hr/><p>Picking up what Iâ€™m putting down? Head over to <a href='http://hollabackapp.com'>hollaback</a> to see what itâ€™s all about it and donâ€™t hesitate to sign up, itâ€™s free! Also, send me an email or hit me up on <a href='https://twitter.com/swlkr'>twitter</a> if you want to give me some feedback, itâ€™s always welcome.</p>
